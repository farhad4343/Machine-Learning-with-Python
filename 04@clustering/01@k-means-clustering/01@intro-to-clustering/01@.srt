00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,355
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:02,355 --> 00:00:06,750
In this video we'll give you a high level introduction to clustering,

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,745
its applications, and different types of clustering algorithms.

4
00:00:10,745 --> 00:00:13,810
Let's get started! Imagine that you have

5
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:19,540
a customer dataset and you need to apply customer segmentation on this historical data.

6
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:23,320
Customer segmentation is the practice of partitioning

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:28,310
a customer base into groups of individuals that have similar characteristics.

8
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,785
It is a significant strategy,

9
00:00:30,785 --> 00:00:34,390
as it allows the business to target specific groups of customers,

10
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:38,095
so as to more effectively allocate marketing resources.

11
00:00:38,095 --> 00:00:43,675
For example, one group might contain customers who are high profit and low risk.

12
00:00:43,675 --> 00:00:48,390
That is; more likely to purchase products or subscribe for a service.

13
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,750
Knowing this information allows a business to devote

14
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,710
more time and attention to retaining these customers.

15
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:01,255
Another group might include customers from nonprofit organizations and so on.

16
00:01:01,255 --> 00:01:07,905
A general segmentation process is not usually feasible for large volumes of very data,

17
00:01:07,905 --> 00:01:11,040
therefore you need an analytical approach to

18
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,460
deriving segments and groups from large datasets.

19
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,440
Customers can be grouped based on several factors, including;

20
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,620
age, gender, interests, spending habits and so on.

21
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,280
The important requirement is to use the available data to

22
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,690
understand and identify how customers are similar to each other.

23
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:34,245
Let's learn how to divide a set of customers into categories,

24
00:01:34,245 --> 00:01:36,825
based on characteristics they share.

25
00:01:36,825 --> 00:01:39,870
One of the most adopted approaches that can be used

26
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,985
for customer segmentation is clustering.

27
00:01:42,985 --> 00:01:46,455
Clustering can group data only unsupervised,

28
00:01:46,455 --> 00:01:49,575
based on the similarity of customers to each other.

29
00:01:49,575 --> 00:01:54,080
It will partition your customers into mutually exclusive groups.

30
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,665
For example, into three clusters.

31
00:01:56,665 --> 00:02:01,655
The customers in each cluster are similar to each other demographically.

32
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:04,505
Now we can create a profile for each group,

33
00:02:04,505 --> 00:02:08,105
considering the common characteristics of each cluster.

34
00:02:08,105 --> 00:02:13,500
For example, the first group made up of affluent and middle aged customers.

35
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,740
The second is made up of young,

36
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,585
educated and middle income customers,

37
00:02:18,585 --> 00:02:23,240
and the third group includes young and low income customers.

38
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,450
Finally, we can assign each individual in

39
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:30,455
our dataset to one of these groups or segments of customers.

40
00:02:30,455 --> 00:02:34,790
Now imagine that you cross join this segmented dataset with

41
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:40,055
the dataset of the product or services that customers purchase from your company.

42
00:02:40,055 --> 00:02:45,050
This information would really help to understand and predict the differences and

43
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:50,910
individual customers preferences and their buying behaviors across various products.

44
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,620
Indeed, having this information would allow your company to

45
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:59,035
develop highly personalized experiences for each segment.

46
00:02:59,035 --> 00:03:03,385
Customer segmentation is one of the popular usages of clustering.

47
00:03:03,385 --> 00:03:08,470
Cluster analysis also has many other applications in different domains.

48
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:13,570
So let's first define clustering and then we'll look at other applications.

49
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:18,925
Clustering means finding clusters in a dataset, unsupervised.

50
00:03:18,925 --> 00:03:21,670
So what is a cluster?

51
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:25,030
A cluster is a group of data points or objects in

52
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:29,110
a dataset that are similar to other objects in the group,

53
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:32,515
and dissimilar to datapoints in other clusters.

54
00:03:32,515 --> 00:03:38,875
Now the question is," What is different between clustering and classification?"

55
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:42,010
Let's look at our customer dataset again.

56
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:46,655
Classification algorithms predict categorical classed labels.

57
00:03:46,655 --> 00:03:54,265
This means assigning instances to predefined classes such as defaulted or not defaulted.

58
00:03:54,265 --> 00:03:57,805
For example, if an analyst wants to analyze

59
00:03:57,805 --> 00:04:02,850
customer data in order to know which customers might default on their payments,

60
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,890
she uses a labeled dataset as

61
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:10,955
training data and uses classification approaches such as a decision tree,

62
00:04:10,955 --> 00:04:14,240
Support Vector Machines or SVM,

63
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:21,655
or logistic regression, to predict the default value for a new or unknown customer.

64
00:04:21,655 --> 00:04:25,900
Generally speaking, classification is a supervised learning

65
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,335
where each training data instance belongs to a particular class.

66
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:36,865
In clustering however, the data is unlabeled and the process is unsupervised.

67
00:04:36,865 --> 00:04:40,660
For example, we can use a clustering algorithm such

68
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:44,455
as k-means to group similar customers as mentioned,

69
00:04:44,455 --> 00:04:46,535
and assign them to a cluster,

70
00:04:46,535 --> 00:04:49,490
based on whether they share similar attributes,

71
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:52,315
such as; age, education, and so on.

72
00:04:52,315 --> 00:04:55,940
While I'll be giving you some examples in different industries,

73
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:59,385
I'd like you to think about more samples of clustering.

74
00:04:59,385 --> 00:05:01,305
In the retail industry,

75
00:05:01,305 --> 00:05:05,510
clustering is used to find associations among customers based on

76
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:08,340
their demographic characteristics and use

77
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:12,765
that information to identify buying patterns of various customer groups.

78
00:05:12,765 --> 00:05:17,520
Also, it can be used in recommendation systems to find a group of

79
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,500
similar items or similar users and use it for collaborative filtering,

80
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,200
to recommend things like books or movies to customers.

81
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,220
In banking, analysts find clusters of

82
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:34,425
normal transactions to find the patterns of fraudulent credit card usage.

83
00:05:34,425 --> 00:05:38,925
Also they use clustering to identify clusters of customers.

84
00:05:38,925 --> 00:05:44,045
For instance, to find loyal customers versus churned customers.

85
00:05:44,045 --> 00:05:46,080
In the insurance industry,

86
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,795
clustering is used for fraud detection in claims analysis,

87
00:05:49,795 --> 00:05:55,615
or to evaluate the insurance risk of certain customers based on their segments.

88
00:05:55,615 --> 00:05:59,530
In publication media, clustering is used to auto

89
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:04,035
categorize news based on his content or to tag news,

90
00:06:04,035 --> 00:06:09,125
then cluster it so as to recommend similar news articles to readers.

91
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:13,720
In medicine, it can be used to characterize patient behavior,

92
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,135
based on their similar characteristics.

93
00:06:16,135 --> 00:06:22,705
So as to identify successful medical therapies for different illnesses or in biology,

94
00:06:22,705 --> 00:06:27,025
clustering is used to group genes with similar expression patterns

95
00:06:27,025 --> 00:06:31,990
or to cluster genetic markers to identify family ties.

96
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:36,535
If you look around you can find many other applications of clustering,

97
00:06:36,535 --> 00:06:40,735
but generally clustering can be used for one of the following purposes;

98
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:46,905
exploratory data analysis, summary generation or reducing the scale,

99
00:06:46,905 --> 00:06:52,705
outlier detection- especially to be used for fraud detection or noise removal,

100
00:06:52,705 --> 00:06:59,265
finding duplicates and datasets or as a pre-processing step for either prediction,

101
00:06:59,265 --> 00:07:04,050
other data mining tasks or as part of a complex system.

102
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:09,025
Let's briefly look at different clustering algorithms and their characteristics.

103
00:07:09,025 --> 00:07:11,860
Partitioned-based clustering is a group of

104
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:15,800
clustering algorithms that produces fear like clusters,

105
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,735
such as; K-Means, K-Medians or Fuzzy c-Means.

106
00:07:20,735 --> 00:07:23,980
These algorithms are relatively efficient and are

107
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:27,275
used for medium and large sized databases.

108
00:07:27,275 --> 00:07:31,750
Hierarchical clustering algorithms produce trees of clusters,

109
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:35,040
such as agglomerative and divisive algorithms.

110
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,200
This group of algorithms are very intuitive

111
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,960
and are generally good for use with small size datasets.

112
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:47,575
Density-based clustering algorithms produce arbitrary shaped clusters.

113
00:07:47,575 --> 00:07:50,260
They are especially good when dealing with

114
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:54,160
spatial clusters or when there is noise in your data set.

115
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,670
For example, the DB scan algorithm.

116
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:01,730
This concludes our video. Thanks for watching!
