00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,270
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:03,675
In this video,

3
00:00:03,675 --> 00:00:08,785
we'll be covering non-linear regression basics. So, let's get started.

4
00:00:08,785 --> 00:00:18,335
These data points correspond to China's gross domestic product or GDP from 1960-2014.

5
00:00:18,335 --> 00:00:22,170
The first column is the years and the second is

6
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:28,690
China's corresponding annual gross domestic income in US dollars for that year.

7
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:31,820
This is what the data points look like.

8
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,235
Now, we have a couple of interesting questions.

9
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:39,745
First, can GDP be predicted based on time?

10
00:00:39,745 --> 00:00:45,075
Second, can we use a simple linear regression to model it?

11
00:00:45,075 --> 00:00:48,860
Indeed. If the data shows a curvy trend,

12
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,395
then linear regression would not produce

13
00:00:51,395 --> 00:00:56,044
very accurate results when compared to a non-linear regression.

14
00:00:56,044 --> 00:00:58,755
Simply because, as the name implies,

15
00:00:58,755 --> 00:01:02,990
linear regression presumes that the data is linear.

16
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:09,735
The scatter plot shows that there seems to be a strong relationship between GDP and time,

17
00:01:09,735 --> 00:01:12,560
but the relationship is not linear.

18
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,344
As you can see, the growth starts off slowly,

19
00:01:16,344 --> 00:01:19,180
then from 2005 onward,

20
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,830
the growth is very significant.

21
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:26,905
Finally, it decelerates slightly in the 2010s.

22
00:01:26,905 --> 00:01:32,235
It looks like either a logistical or exponential function.

23
00:01:32,235 --> 00:01:39,620
So, it requires a special estimation method of the non-linear regression procedure.

24
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:45,575
For example, if we assume that the model for these data points are exponential functions,

25
00:01:45,575 --> 00:01:49,810
such as Y hat equals Theta zero plus Theta

26
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:55,140
one Theta two transpose X or to the power of X,

27
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,730
our job is to estimate the parameters of the model, i.e., Thetas,

28
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:07,260
and use the fitted model to predict GDP for unknown or future cases.

29
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,910
In fact, many different regressions exists

30
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:14,480
that can be used to fit whatever the dataset looks like.

31
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,460
You can see a quadratic and cubic regression lines here,

32
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:23,630
and it can go on and on to infinite degrees.

33
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:28,040
In essence, we can call all of these polynomial regression,

34
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,340
where the relationship between the independent variable X and

35
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:39,200
the dependent variable Y is modeled as an Nth degree polynomial in X.

36
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,790
With many types of regression to choose from,

37
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:46,545
there's a good chance that one will fit your dataset well.

38
00:02:46,545 --> 00:02:52,230
Remember, it's important to pick a regression that fits the data the best.

39
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:56,190
So, what is polynomial regression?

40
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:00,430
Polynomial regression fits a curve line to your data.

41
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:09,015
A simple example of polynomial with degree three is shown as Y hat equals Theta zero

42
00:03:09,015 --> 00:03:18,285
plus Theta 1_X plus Theta 2_X squared plus Theta 3_X cubed or to the power of three,

43
00:03:18,285 --> 00:03:22,190
where Thetas are parameters to be estimated that

44
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:26,660
makes the model fit perfectly to the underlying data.

45
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,110
Though the relationship between X and Y is

46
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:34,965
non-linear here and polynomial regression can't fit them,

47
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:41,450
a polynomial regression model can still be expressed as linear regression.

48
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,910
I know it's a bit confusing,

49
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,400
but let's look at an example.

50
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,000
Given the third degree polynomial equation,

51
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:59,020
by defining X_1 equals X and X_2 equals X squared or X to the power of two and so on,

52
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:06,475
the model is converted to a simple linear regression with new variables as Y hat equals

53
00:04:06,475 --> 00:04:15,060
Theta zero plus Theta one X_1 plus Theta two X_2 plus Theta three X_3.

54
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:20,080
This model is linear in the parameters to be estimated, right?

55
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:24,610
Therefore, this polynomial regression is considered to

56
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:29,710
be a special case of traditional multiple linear regression.

57
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:36,400
So, you can use the same mechanism as linear regression to solve such a problem.

58
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:44,405
Therefore, polynomial regression models can fit using the model of least squares.

59
00:04:44,405 --> 00:04:47,620
Least squares is a method for estimating

60
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:53,420
the unknown parameters in a linear regression model by minimizing the sum of

61
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,000
the squares of the differences between

62
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,280
the observed dependent variable in

63
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:03,095
the given dataset and those predicted by the linear function.

64
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:07,565
So, what is non-linear regression exactly?

65
00:05:07,565 --> 00:05:11,735
First, non-linear regression is a method to model

66
00:05:11,735 --> 00:05:14,390
a non-linear relationship between

67
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:18,470
the dependent variable and a set of independent variables.

68
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:22,370
Second, for a model to be considered non-linear,

69
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:27,555
Y hat must be a non-linear function of the parameters Theta,

70
00:05:27,555 --> 00:05:30,570
not necessarily the features X.

71
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:33,395
When it comes to non-linear equation,

72
00:05:33,395 --> 00:05:35,770
it can be the shape of exponential,

73
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:40,605
logarithmic, and logistic, or many other types.

74
00:05:40,605 --> 00:05:43,920
As you can see in all of these equations,

75
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,745
the change of Y hat depends on changes in the parameters Theta,

76
00:05:48,745 --> 00:05:51,730
not necessarily on X only.

77
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:54,550
That is, in non-linear regression,

78
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:58,305
a model is non-linear by parameters.

79
00:05:58,305 --> 00:06:01,190
In contrast to linear regression,

80
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:08,055
we cannot use the ordinary least squares method to fit the data in non-linear regression.

81
00:06:08,055 --> 00:06:13,240
In general, estimation of the parameters is not easy.

82
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,035
Let me answer two important questions here.

83
00:06:17,035 --> 00:06:23,510
First, how can I know if a problem is linear or non-linear in an easy way?

84
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,605
To answer this question,

85
00:06:25,605 --> 00:06:27,975
we have to do two things.

86
00:06:27,975 --> 00:06:34,125
The first is to visually figure out if the relation is linear or non-linear.

87
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:40,725
It's best to plot bivariate plots of output variables with each input variable.

88
00:06:40,725 --> 00:06:44,805
Also, you can calculate the correlation coefficient

89
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:48,770
between independent and dependent variables, and if,

90
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:52,710
for all variables, it is 0.7 or higher,

91
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:55,920
there is a linear tendency and thus,

92
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,910
it's not appropriate to fit a non-linear regression.

93
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:05,410
The second thing we have to do is to use non-linear regression instead of

94
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:07,705
linear regression when we cannot

95
00:07:07,705 --> 00:07:11,580
accurately model the relationship with linear parameters.

96
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,530
The second important question is,

97
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:20,690
how should I model my data if it displays non-linear on a scatter plot?

98
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,160
Well, to address this,

99
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,435
you have to use either a polynomial regression,

100
00:07:26,435 --> 00:07:28,940
use a non-linear regression model,

101
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,130
or transform your data,

102
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:33,745
which is not in scope for this course.

103
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:35,800
Thanks for watching.
