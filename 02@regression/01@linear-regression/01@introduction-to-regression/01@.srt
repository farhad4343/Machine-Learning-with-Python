00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,025
Hello, and welcome.

2
00:00:02,025 --> 00:00:03,395
In this video,

3
00:00:03,395 --> 00:00:06,180
we'll be giving a brief introduction to regression.

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,750
So, let's get started.

5
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,655
Look at this data set,

6
00:00:09,655 --> 00:00:13,205
it's related to CO_2 emissions from different cars.

7
00:00:13,205 --> 00:00:16,540
It includes engine size, number of cylinders,

8
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:21,750
fuel consumption, and CO_2 emission from various automobile models.

9
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,310
The question is, given this data set,

10
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:28,195
can we predict the CO_2 emission of a car,

11
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:32,725
using other fields such as engine size, or cylinders?

12
00:00:32,725 --> 00:00:36,805
Let's assume we have some historical data from different cars,

13
00:00:36,805 --> 00:00:38,715
and assume that a car such as,

14
00:00:38,715 --> 00:00:41,520
in row nine has not been manufactured yet,

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,420
but we're interested in estimating its approximate CO_2 emission, after production.

16
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,225
Is it possible?

17
00:00:49,225 --> 00:00:55,565
We can use regression methods to predict a continuous value such as CO_2 emission,

18
00:00:55,565 --> 00:00:57,905
using some other variables.

19
00:00:57,905 --> 00:01:03,400
Indeed, regression is the process of predicting a continuous value.

20
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,800
In regression, there are two types of variables,

21
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,695
a dependent variable, and one or more independent variables.

22
00:01:11,695 --> 00:01:15,065
The dependent variable, can be seen as the state,

23
00:01:15,065 --> 00:01:17,715
target, or final goal we study,

24
00:01:17,715 --> 00:01:19,125
and try to predict,

25
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:21,360
and the independent variables,

26
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,205
also known as explanatory variables,

27
00:01:24,205 --> 00:01:27,150
can be seen as the causes of those states.

28
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,910
The independent variables are shown conventionally by X,

29
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:35,920
and the dependent variable is notated by Y.

30
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,530
Our regression model relates Y,

31
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,370
or the dependent variable,

32
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,970
to a function of X i.e.

33
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,025
The independent variables.

34
00:01:45,025 --> 00:01:47,150
The key point in the regression,

35
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:50,045
is that our dependent value should be continuous,

36
00:01:50,045 --> 00:01:52,805
and cannot be a discrete value.

37
00:01:52,805 --> 00:01:56,995
However, the independent variable or variables,

38
00:01:56,995 --> 00:02:00,270
can be measured on either a categorical,

39
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,305
or continuous measurement scale.

40
00:02:03,305 --> 00:02:08,905
So, what we want to do here is to use the historical data of some cars,

41
00:02:08,905 --> 00:02:14,480
using one or more of their features and from that data, make a model.

42
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,385
We use regression to build such a regression estimation model,

43
00:02:19,385 --> 00:02:26,575
then the model is used to predict the expected CO_2 emission for a new, or unknown car.

44
00:02:26,575 --> 00:02:30,125
Basically, there are two types of regression models.

45
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:33,250
Simple regression, and multiple regression.

46
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,160
Simple regression is when

47
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,620
one independent variable is used to estimate a dependent variable.

48
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,005
It can be either linear, or non-linear.

49
00:02:43,005 --> 00:02:48,655
For example, predicting CO_2 emission using the variable of engine size.

50
00:02:48,655 --> 00:02:52,140
Linearity of regression, is based on the nature of

51
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:56,295
relationship between independent, and dependent variables.

52
00:02:56,295 --> 00:02:59,910
When more than one independent variable is present,

53
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:03,125
the processes is called multiple linear regression.

54
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:07,800
For example, predicting CO_2 emission using engine size,

55
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,170
and the number of cylinders in any given car.

56
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:16,845
Again, depending on the relation between dependent and independent variables,

57
00:03:16,845 --> 00:03:20,745
it can be either linear, or nonlinear regression.

58
00:03:20,745 --> 00:03:24,760
Let's examine some sample applications of regression.

59
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:30,535
Essentially, we use regression when we want to estimate a continuous value.

60
00:03:30,535 --> 00:03:33,480
For instance, one of the applications of

61
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,845
regression analysis could be in the area of sales forecasting.

62
00:03:37,845 --> 00:03:43,505
You can try to predict a salesperson's total yearly sales from independent variables,

63
00:03:43,505 --> 00:03:45,770
such as age, education,

64
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:47,760
and years of experience.

65
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,710
It can also be used in the field of psychology for example,

66
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:57,610
to determine individual satisfaction based on demographic, and psychological factors.

67
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:02,510
We can use regression analysis to predict the price of a house in an area,

68
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,730
based on its size,

69
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:06,095
number of bedrooms, and so on.

70
00:04:06,095 --> 00:04:09,679
We can even use it to predict employment income,

71
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:14,440
for independent variables such as hours of work, education,

72
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:19,975
occupation, sex age, years of experience, and so on.

73
00:04:19,975 --> 00:04:23,800
Indeed you can find many examples of the usefulness of

74
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,370
regression analysis in these and many other fields,

75
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,595
or domains such as finance,

76
00:04:29,595 --> 00:04:32,310
healthcare, retail, and more.

77
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:35,350
We have many regression algorithms.

78
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,630
Each of them has its own importance,

79
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:41,785
and a specific condition to which their application is best suited,

80
00:04:41,785 --> 00:04:45,340
and while we've covered just a few of them in this course,

81
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:50,170
it gives you enough base knowledge for you to explore different regression techniques.

82
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,070
Thanks for watching.
