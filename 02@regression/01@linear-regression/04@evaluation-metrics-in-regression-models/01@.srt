00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,355
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:02,355 --> 00:00:03,760
In this video,

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:09,460
we'll be covering accuracy metrics for model evaluation. So let's get started.

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:14,545
Evaluation metrics are used to explain the performance of a model.

5
00:00:14,545 --> 00:00:19,350
Let's talk more about the model evaluation metrics that are used for regression.

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:25,680
As mentioned, basically, we can compare the actual values and predicted values,

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,930
to calculate the accuracy of our regression model.

8
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:33,780
Evaluation metrics, provide a key role in the development of a model,

9
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,100
as it provides insight to areas that require improvement.

10
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,350
We'll be reviewing a number of model evaluation metrics including;

11
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:48,225
mean absolute error, mean squared error and root mean squared error.

12
00:00:48,225 --> 00:00:51,360
But before we get into defining these,

13
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,725
we need to define what an error actually is.

14
00:00:54,725 --> 00:00:56,955
In the context of regression,

15
00:00:56,955 --> 00:00:59,880
the error of the model is the difference between

16
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,915
the data points and the trend line generated by the algorithm.

17
00:01:03,915 --> 00:01:06,300
Since there are multiple data points,

18
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,700
an error can be determined in multiple ways.

19
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:15,380
Mean absolute error is the mean of the absolute value of the errors.

20
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,555
This is the easiest of the metrics to understand,

21
00:01:18,555 --> 00:01:20,965
since it's just the average error.

22
00:01:20,965 --> 00:01:25,420
Mean squared error is the mean of the squared error.

23
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:28,469
It's more popular than mean absolute error,

24
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:32,670
because the focus is geared more towards large errors.

25
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,990
This is due to the squared term,

26
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:39,885
exponentially increasing larger errors in comparison to smaller ones.

27
00:01:39,885 --> 00:01:45,830
Root mean squared error is the square root of the mean squared error.

28
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:49,610
This is one of the most popular of the evaluation metrics,

29
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:53,210
because root mean squared error is interpretable

30
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:57,370
in the same units as the response vector or y units,

31
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:00,810
making it easy to relate its information.

32
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:06,065
Relative absolute error, also known as residual sum of square,

33
00:02:06,065 --> 00:02:09,695
where y bar is a mean value of y,

34
00:02:09,695 --> 00:02:13,790
takes the total absolute error and normalizes it by

35
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:18,480
dividing by the total absolute error of the simple predictor.

36
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,540
Relative squared error is very similar to relative absolute error,

37
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,930
but is widely adopted by the data science community,

38
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:29,960
as it is used for calculating R squared.

39
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,960
R squared is not an error per se,

40
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,410
but is a popular metric for the accuracy of your model.

41
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:40,210
It represents how close the data values are,

42
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:42,510
to the fitted regression line.

43
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,675
The higher the R-squared,

44
00:02:44,675 --> 00:02:47,370
the better the model fits your data.

45
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,805
Each of these metrics can be used for quantifying of your prediction.

46
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:53,600
The choice of metric,

47
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,300
completely depends on the type of model,

48
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,450
your data type and domain of knowledge.

49
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:04,045
Unfortunately, further review is out of scope of this course.

50
00:03:04,045 --> 00:03:06,330
Thanks for watching.
