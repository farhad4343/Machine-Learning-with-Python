00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,965
Hello and welcome to machine learning with Python.

2
00:00:03,965 --> 00:00:07,170
In this course, you'll learn how machine learning

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,490
is used in many key fields and industries.

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:13,585
For example, in the healthcare industry,

5
00:00:13,585 --> 00:00:18,060
data scientists use machine learning to predict whether a human cell that is

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:23,385
believed to be at risk of developing cancer is either benign or malignant.

7
00:00:23,385 --> 00:00:26,070
As such, machine learning can play

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,055
a key role in determining a person's health and welfare.

9
00:00:30,055 --> 00:00:33,820
You'll also learn about the value of decision trees,

10
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,885
and how building a good decision tree from historical data

11
00:00:37,885 --> 00:00:43,255
helps doctors to prescribe the proper medicine for each of their patients.

12
00:00:43,255 --> 00:00:46,750
You'll learn how bankers use machine learning to make

13
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,690
decisions on whether to approve loan applications.

14
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:55,890
You will learn how to use machine learning to do bank customer segmentation,

15
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:01,785
where it is not usually easy to run for huge volumes of varied data.

16
00:01:01,785 --> 00:01:08,380
In this course, you'll see how machine learning helps websites such as YouTube, Amazon,

17
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:13,960
or Netflix develop recommendations to their customers about various products or

18
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,780
services such as which movies they might be

19
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,380
interested in going to see or which books to buy.

20
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:24,390
There is so much that you can do with machine learning.

21
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,855
Here, you'll learn how to use popular Python libraries to build your model.

22
00:01:29,855 --> 00:01:33,460
For example given an automobile dataset,

23
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,790
we can use the scikit-learn library to estimate

24
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:42,130
the CO2 emission of cars using their engine size or cylinders.

25
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:45,320
We can even predict what the CO2 emissions will

26
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,805
be for a car that hasn't even been produced yet.

27
00:01:48,805 --> 00:01:54,515
We'll see how the telecommunications industries can predict customer churn.

28
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:57,145
You can run and practice the code of

29
00:01:57,145 --> 00:02:01,990
all these samples using the built-in lab environment in this course.

30
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:07,555
You don't have to install anything to your computer or do anything on the cloud.

31
00:02:07,555 --> 00:02:13,285
All you have to do is click a button to start the lab environment in your browser.

32
00:02:13,285 --> 00:02:19,585
The code for the samples is already written using Python language in Jupiter notebooks,

33
00:02:19,585 --> 00:02:26,440
and you can run it to see the results or change it to understand the algorithms better.

34
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,240
So, what will you be able to achieve by taking this course?

35
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:36,045
Well, by putting in just a few hours a week over the next few weeks,

36
00:02:36,045 --> 00:02:40,800
you'll get new skills to add to your resume such as regression,

37
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,180
classification, clustering, scikit-learn, and scipy.

38
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:49,410
You'll also get new projects that you can add to

39
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,505
your portfolio including cancer detection,

40
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:56,670
predicting economic trends, predicting customer churn,

41
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:00,045
recommendation engines, and many more.

42
00:03:00,045 --> 00:03:06,450
You'll also get a certificate in machine learning to prove your competency and share

43
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:13,110
it anywhere you like online or offline such as LinkedIn profiles and social media.

44
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,530
So, let's get started.
