1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,085
Hello, and welcome.

2
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:08,120
In this video we'll introduce supervised algorithms, versus unsupervised algorithms.

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,005
So, let's get started.

4
00:00:10,005 --> 00:00:13,320
An easy way to begin grasping the concept of

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,875
supervised learning is by looking directly at the words that make it up.

6
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:20,440
Supervise, means to observe,

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,940
and direct the execution of a task, project, or activity.

8
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:28,615
Obviously we aren't going to be supervising a person,

9
00:00:28,615 --> 00:00:32,680
instead will be supervising a machine learning model that

10
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,965
might be able to produce classification regions like we see here.

11
00:00:36,965 --> 00:00:41,320
So, how do we supervise a machine learning model?

12
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,295
We do this by teaching the model,

13
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:49,735
that is we load the model with knowledge so that we can have it predict future instances.

14
00:00:49,735 --> 00:00:53,470
But this leads to the next question which is,

15
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,220
how exactly do we teach a model?

16
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:01,360
We teach the model by training it with some data from a labeled dataset.

17
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,820
It's important to note that the data is labeled,

18
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,740
and what does a labeled dataset look like?

19
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,425
Well, it could look something like this.

20
00:01:10,425 --> 00:01:14,150
This example is taken from the cancer dataset.

21
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:18,340
As you can see, we have some historical data for patients,

22
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,235
and we already know the class of each row.

23
00:01:21,235 --> 00:01:25,440
Let's start by introducing some components of this table.

24
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,220
The names up here which are called clump thickness,

25
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,240
uniformity of cell size,

26
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,335
uniformity of cell shape,

27
00:01:33,335 --> 00:01:37,950
marginal adhesion and so on are called attributes.

28
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,560
The columns are called features which include the data.

29
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,570
If you plot this data,

30
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,220
and look at a single data point on a plot,

31
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,830
it'll have all of these attributes that would make

32
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:55,495
a row on this chart also referred to as an observation.

33
00:01:55,495 --> 00:01:58,190
Looking directly at the value of the data,

34
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:00,550
you can have two kinds.

35
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,935
The first is numerical.

36
00:02:02,935 --> 00:02:05,230
When dealing with machine learning,

37
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:08,040
the most commonly used data is numeric.

38
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,410
The second is categorical,

39
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:15,470
that is its non-numeric because it contains characters rather than numbers.

40
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:21,675
In this case, it's categorical because this dataset is made for classification.

41
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:25,710
There are two types of supervised learning techniques.

42
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:29,565
They are; classification, and regression.

43
00:02:29,565 --> 00:02:36,300
Classification is the process of predicting a discrete class label, or category.

44
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,280
Regression is the process of predicting

45
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:45,290
a continuous value as opposed to predicting a categorical value in classification.

46
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,290
Look at this dataset.

47
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:51,070
It is related to CO2 emissions of different cars.

48
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:54,265
It includes; engine size, cylinders,

49
00:02:54,265 --> 00:02:59,615
fuel consumption, and CO2 emission of various models of automobiles.

50
00:02:59,615 --> 00:03:03,320
Given this dataset, you can use regression to predict

51
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:08,600
the CO2 emission of a new car by using other fields such as engine size,

52
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,740
or number of cylinders.

53
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,060
Since we know the meaning of supervised learning,

54
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,225
what do you think unsupervised learning means?

55
00:03:17,225 --> 00:03:21,775
Yes, unsupervised learning is exactly as it sounds.

56
00:03:21,775 --> 00:03:24,150
We do not supervise the model,

57
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,130
but we let the model work on its own to discover

58
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:30,680
information that may not be visible to the human eye.

59
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,985
It means, the unsupervised algorithm trains on the dataset,

60
00:03:35,985 --> 00:03:39,705
and draws conclusions on unlabeled data.

61
00:03:39,705 --> 00:03:44,709
Generally speaking, unsupervised learning has more difficult algorithms

62
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:49,450
than supervised learning since we know little to no information about the data,

63
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:52,290
or the outcomes that are to be expected.

64
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:56,230
Dimension reduction, density estimation,

65
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,640
market basket analysis, and clustering are

66
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,825
the most widely used unsupervised machine learning techniques.

67
00:04:03,825 --> 00:04:07,940
Dimensionality reduction, and/or feature selection,

68
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,560
play a large role in this by reducing

69
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,625
redundant features to make the classification easier.

70
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:18,300
Market basket analysis is a modeling technique

71
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,930
based upon the theory that if you buy a certain group of items,

72
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:25,070
you're more likely to buy another group of items.

73
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:29,100
Density estimation is a very simple concept that is

74
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,510
mostly used to explore the data to find some structure within it.

75
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,630
And finally, clustering.

76
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,950
Clustering is considered to be one of

77
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:43,490
the most popular unsupervised machine learning techniques used for grouping data points,

78
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:46,090
or objects that are somehow similar.

79
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:50,855
Cluster analysis has many applications in different domains,

80
00:04:50,855 --> 00:04:56,185
whether it be a bank's desire to segment his customers based on certain characteristics,

81
00:04:56,185 --> 00:04:59,720
or helping an individual to organize in-group his,

82
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,065
or her favorite types of music.

83
00:05:02,065 --> 00:05:07,475
Generally speaking though, clustering is used mostly for discovering structure,

84
00:05:07,475 --> 00:05:10,955
summarization, and anomaly detection.

85
00:05:10,955 --> 00:05:15,580
So, to recap, the biggest difference between supervised,

86
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,660
and unsupervised learning is that supervised learning deals with

87
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:25,165
labeled data while unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data.

88
00:05:25,165 --> 00:05:27,490
In supervised learning, we have

89
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,670
machine learning algorithms for classification, and regression.

90
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:36,195
In unsupervised learning, we have methods such as clustering.

91
00:05:36,195 --> 00:05:39,090
In comparison to supervised learning,

92
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:42,160
unsupervised learning has fewer models,

93
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,040
and fewer evaluation methods that can be used

94
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,635
to ensure that the outcome of the model is accurate.

95
00:05:48,635 --> 00:05:51,790
As such, unsupervised learning creates

96
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,940
a less controllable environment as the machine is

97
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:59,400
creating outcomes for us. Thanks for watching.
