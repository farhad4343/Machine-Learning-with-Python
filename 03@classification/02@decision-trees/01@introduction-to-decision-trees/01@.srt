00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,195
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:02,195 --> 00:00:03,555
In this video,

3
00:00:03,555 --> 00:00:07,080
we're going to introduce an examine decision trees.

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,775
So let's get started.

5
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:11,975
What exactly is a decision tree?

6
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:14,825
How do we use them to help us classify?

7
00:00:14,825 --> 00:00:17,790
How can I grow my own decision tree?

8
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,370
These may be some of the questions that you have in

9
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,570
mind from hearing the term decision tree.

10
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:26,280
Hopefully, you'll soon be able to answer

11
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,420
these questions and many more by watching this video.

12
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,370
Imagine that you're a medical researcher compiling data for a study.

13
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,190
You've already collected data about a set of

14
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,270
patients all of whom suffered from the same illness.

15
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,390
During their course of treatment,

16
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:47,640
each patient responded to one of two medications.

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,820
We call them drug A and drug B.

18
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,090
Part of your job is to build a model to find out which drug

19
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:59,485
might be appropriate for a future patient with the same illness.

20
00:00:59,485 --> 00:01:04,455
The feature sets of this dataset are age, gender,

21
00:01:04,455 --> 00:01:07,540
blood pressure and cholesterol of our group of

22
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:13,145
patients and the target is the drug that each patient responded to.

23
00:01:13,145 --> 00:01:17,380
It is a sample of binary classifiers and you can

24
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:21,550
use the training part of the data set to build a decision tree.

25
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:26,210
Then use it to predict the class of unknown patient.

26
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:32,480
In essence, to come up with a decision on which drug to prescribe to a new patient.

27
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,865
Let's see how a decision tree is built for this dataset.

28
00:01:36,865 --> 00:01:42,110
Decision trees are built by splitting the training set into distinct nodes,

29
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:48,045
where one node contains all of or most of one category of the data.

30
00:01:48,045 --> 00:01:50,660
If we look at the diagram here,

31
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,510
we can see that it's a patient's classifier.

32
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:58,245
So as mentioned, we want to prescribe a drug to a new patient,

33
00:01:58,245 --> 00:02:05,210
but the decision to choose drug A or B will be influenced by the patient's situation.

34
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,165
We start with age,

35
00:02:07,165 --> 00:02:10,850
which can be young, middle aged or senior.

36
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:13,320
If the patient is middle aged,

37
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,805
then we'll definitely go for drug B.

38
00:02:15,805 --> 00:02:19,795
On the other hand, if he has a young or a senior patient,

39
00:02:19,795 --> 00:02:24,140
will need more details to help us determine which drug to prescribe.

40
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:29,445
The additional decision variables can be things such as cholesterol levels,

41
00:02:29,445 --> 00:02:31,720
gender or blood pressure.

42
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,955
For example, if the patient is female,

43
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:37,475
then we will recommend drug A,

44
00:02:37,475 --> 00:02:39,970
but if the patient is male,

45
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:42,115
then will go for drug B.

46
00:02:42,115 --> 00:02:43,800
As you can see,

47
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,020
decision trees are about testing an attribute and

48
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,630
branching the cases based on the result of the test.

49
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:54,530
Each internal node corresponds to a test,

50
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:58,660
and each branch corresponds to a result of the test,

51
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:03,414
and each leaf node assigns a patient to a class.

52
00:03:03,414 --> 00:03:05,310
Now the question is,

53
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,010
how can we build such a decision tree?

54
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,250
Here is the way that a decision tree is build.

55
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:17,205
A decision tree can be constructed by considering the attributes one by one.

56
00:03:17,205 --> 00:03:21,234
First, choose an attribute from our dataset.

57
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:26,100
Calculate the significance of the attribute in the splitting of the data.

58
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,600
In the next video,

59
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,400
we will explain how to calculate the significance of

60
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,395
an attribute to see if it's an effective attribute or not.

61
00:03:34,395 --> 00:03:39,790
Next, split the data based on the value of the best attribute,

62
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:44,990
then go to each branch and repeat it for the rest of the attributes.

63
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,990
After building this tree,

64
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:52,179
you can use it to predict the class of unknown cases or in our case,

65
00:03:52,179 --> 00:03:57,610
the proper drug for a new patient based on his or her characteristics.

66
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,030
This concludes this video.

67
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,000
Thanks for watching.
