1
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,855
All right, so in this video,

2
00:00:08,855 --> 00:00:13,690
I will walk you through the process of creating a project on Watson Studio for discourse,

3
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:17,170
and I'll show you how to create notebooks under that project,

4
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:20,680
and how to share them with your peers since your submissions in

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:25,660
this course will be mainly notebooks shared from your Watson Studio account.

6
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:30,410
It's very important that you familiarize yourself with this process.

7
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:33,030
Let's go to Watson Studio,

8
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,275
and log into your account.

9
00:00:34,275 --> 00:00:36,730
When you click sign in,

10
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,180
you should land on this page.

11
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,925
This is the landing page of your account,

12
00:00:46,925 --> 00:00:51,385
here you can see a summary and overview of your account for example,

13
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:55,315
any projects that you created or are currently working on,

14
00:00:55,315 --> 00:00:57,820
any catalogs that you created so you can

15
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,969
organize your assets and your projects into catalogs,

16
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:06,050
or any Watson services that you signed up for and you're currently using,

17
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,645
but since you just created your account,

18
00:01:10,645 --> 00:01:12,910
then you shouldn't have any projects listed.

19
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,100
To create a project,

20
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,420
you can simply click on the New project icon,

21
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,560
so you click on that.

22
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:27,940
Watson Studio supports different types of projects ranging from very basic projects to

23
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,520
very complicated ones involving

24
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:35,480
Deep Learning and Visual Recognition and Data Engineering.

25
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,000
The beautiful thing about Watson Studio is that

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,360
the environment for each project is prepped for you,

27
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,229
meaning each project comes with a suite of tools and services

28
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:48,780
pre-installed for your convenience so you don't

29
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,750
have to worry and spend time installing them.

30
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,860
If you expect to use all of the different concepts shown here,

31
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,635
then you can start a complete project.

32
00:01:58,635 --> 00:02:01,950
But in our case we're simply analyzing

33
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,315
neighborhood data and we're not doing any extensive machine learning work,

34
00:02:06,315 --> 00:02:09,780
so creating a Data Science project should suffice.

35
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:15,490
Let's click on Data Science and click okay.

36
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:38,230
Now here, we get to name our project and briefly describe it

37
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:43,790
for a reference or friendly collaborators who will be joining anytime in the future.

38
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:54,480
Let's name our project Coursera_ Capstone and give it a brief description.

39
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:02,085
I'm going to use Coursera Capstone Project-

40
00:03:02,085 --> 00:03:07,570
Analyzing Neighborhood Data.

41
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,955
Now for this option,

42
00:03:13,955 --> 00:03:17,335
if you'll be sharing your code with any external collaborator,

43
00:03:17,335 --> 00:03:20,200
which in this case you will since you will be sharing

44
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,385
the code with your peers for peer evaluation and assessment,

45
00:03:24,385 --> 00:03:27,400
then you can uncheck this box in order to

46
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,495
avoid any restriction on who you can share the project with.

47
00:03:31,495 --> 00:03:35,860
Now before we can proceed we need to define our storage

48
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:40,500
where all of our files will be stored this involves two steps,

49
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,090
in the first step,

50
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,954
we will create a storage service,

51
00:03:44,954 --> 00:03:51,940
and then in the second step we'll have to come back and refresh for the service tip here.

52
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,770
Let's do the first step now,

53
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,940
so click on Add.

54
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:06,885
All right this page shows the storage service features and the different plans available,

55
00:04:06,885 --> 00:04:10,605
we will go with the default free plan, the Lite plan.

56
00:04:10,605 --> 00:04:17,890
It should be more than enough for this course. Click create.

57
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:26,745
You can go with the Default settings and just click Confirm. There you go.

58
00:04:26,745 --> 00:04:28,860
Now the service has been created,

59
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,190
we can go ahead and Refresh for the service to appear.

60
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,710
Click Refresh.

61
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:39,170
There you go and then scroll down and click Create.

62
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:47,970
Awesome, so now that the project has been created.

63
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,280
This is the overview page of

64
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:57,075
the project and now we can start creating notebooks to start building our code.

65
00:04:57,075 --> 00:05:00,375
The notebooks are referred to as Assets to this project.

66
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:06,730
You can click on Add to project and select Notebook from the drop-down menu.

67
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:15,065
Now on this page we can decide whether we want to create a Blank notebook,

68
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:17,150
or a notebook from a file,

69
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,670
or notebook from URL.

70
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:22,125
Now for this course we're starting from scratch,

71
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:24,975
so we'll have to create a Blank notebook.

72
00:05:24,975 --> 00:05:30,695
Let's give it a name, I'm going to name it

73
00:05:30,695 --> 00:05:38,890
Capstone_Intro_Notebook and you can give it a brief description.

74
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:48,365
I'm just going to say Capstone Project Demonstration Notebook.

75
00:05:48,365 --> 00:05:55,630
We will be using a Python 3 kernel and the default server for runtime.

76
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:01,750
So we scroll down and we click Create Notebook.

77
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,340
It will take some time to initialize the notebook.

78
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:35,870
Right, almost there, and there you go.

79
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,470
Now this is a typical Jupyter Notebook,

80
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:42,100
so all the Notebook features can be used here.

81
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,265
You can create Markdown cells for example,

82
00:06:45,265 --> 00:06:53,850
let me go ahead and create a title and call this Capstone Project Notebook.

83
00:06:53,850 --> 00:07:02,050
Right, you can run code so you can do mathematical operations, so 1+1,

84
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:09,140
or 1+2 it will give you the answer you can execute a print statement,

85
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:15,530
'I am excited about this course!'

86
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:20,440
One thing that's really cool about these notebooks is

87
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,025
that if you have a cell that contains

88
00:07:24,025 --> 00:07:27,760
your credentials or other sensitive information and you don't want

89
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,730
to share that with either your peers or other collaborators,

90
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:36,100
you can simply add a comment to that cell and it will hide the content.

91
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:43,850
See what you do, add a comment using, @hidden_cell,

92
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,690
let's say define my credentials,

93
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:58,005
password one, two, three, four, five, right?

94
00:07:58,005 --> 00:08:01,960
When you do that and you share the notebook the content will be

95
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:06,380
hidden and I'll show you how the cell looks like after you share the notebook.

96
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:10,715
All right, now to share your notebook you have two options.

97
00:08:10,715 --> 00:08:13,540
There is direct share using a link to

98
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:19,675
this notebook and you do that by clicking the share icon.

99
00:08:19,675 --> 00:08:25,010
So it opens this model and then you need to activate sharing

100
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:29,945
the notebook and you have three options.

101
00:08:29,945 --> 00:08:34,810
You can either share only text and output or you can share

102
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:36,500
all the content excluding

103
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:41,940
sensitive code cells or you share the entire notebook including the code.

104
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,730
So just to be safe,

105
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:52,865
it's better to go with the second option and it tells you what this option means.

106
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:58,220
It means that you can exclude code cells containing sensitive data.

107
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:04,085
The way to share that notebook is you just copy this link and you paste it somewhere.

108
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,990
So you look you will paste it on

109
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:09,270
the Coursera website where you'll be asked to share a link to

110
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:12,190
the notebook or you can email it or

111
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:15,120
send it to any other collaborator you'll be working with.

112
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,895
So this is the first option to share a notebook.

113
00:09:17,895 --> 00:09:23,035
Now the other option which is the one I like to use and recommend

114
00:09:23,035 --> 00:09:28,485
is the option to share your notebook by publishing it to your GitHub repository.

115
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,710
To do that, you will need to do two things.

116
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:37,365
Number one, create a personal access token and add it to your Watson Studio account,

117
00:09:37,365 --> 00:09:42,165
and number two is to link your project to your GitHub repository.

118
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:45,330
Now, before we create the personal access token,

119
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,400
let me show you where you have to paste it.

120
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:55,300
So go to your profile icon and select settings from the dropdown menu.

121
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,960
Now, on your account settings page,

122
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,620
select the Integrations tab and this is

123
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:09,460
the field where you have to paste your personal access token.

124
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,925
Now to create this token,

125
00:10:11,925 --> 00:10:15,310
go to your GitHub account,

126
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,815
click on your profile image and select Settings from the dropdown menu,

127
00:10:22,815 --> 00:10:31,660
and then on the left menu select Developers Settings and then Personal access tokens.

128
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:35,260
Click Generate new token.

129
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,380
Now, give it a name.

130
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:42,555
I'm going to use capstone project

131
00:10:42,555 --> 00:10:48,405
token and I'm going to give myself full access.

132
00:10:48,405 --> 00:10:58,900
I'm going to select everything here and then click Generate token.

133
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,370
Now, make sure to copy this token because

134
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,960
as the message says here you won't be able to see it again.

135
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,655
So click on this Copy icon. Now, it's copied.

136
00:11:09,655 --> 00:11:15,000
Now, go back to your Watson Studio account and paste the token.

137
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:24,430
Now, click Save and your GitHub account is now linked to your Watson Studio account.

138
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:33,210
So the next thing we have to do is to link the project to a GitHub repository.

139
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:38,260
Now, you can either link it to an existing repository or to start

140
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:44,880
a new and clean repository and use it exclusively for this Capstone course.

141
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,730
This is the option that I recommend.

142
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:55,860
You can easily do that by simply going into your GitHub account and by clicking on

143
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,795
the Add sign next to your profile image or

144
00:11:58,795 --> 00:12:03,900
icon and selecting New repository from the dropdown menu.

145
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:06,645
Now, give it a name. I'm going to name it

146
00:12:06,645 --> 00:12:12,960
Coursera capstone project and

147
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:17,470
make sure to check the box to initialize the repository with a README file.

148
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,525
It's always a good practice to do that,

149
00:12:19,525 --> 00:12:22,950
and then click Create repository.

150
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:27,810
Awesome. So now that the repository is created,

151
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:30,075
let's link our project to it.

152
00:12:30,075 --> 00:12:33,450
So let's go back to our Watson Studio account.

153
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:35,715
Click on Projects.

154
00:12:35,715 --> 00:12:41,700
Now, you should be able to find your project in the dropdown menu so click on it.

155
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,955
Then go to the settings tab.

156
00:12:44,955 --> 00:12:49,215
Now, scroll down to this section that says connect to

157
00:12:49,215 --> 00:12:56,260
a GitHub repository and now enter the address to the repository. So, mine,

158
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:12,825
Cousera capstone project.

159
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:19,690
Once you're done hit Connect and now your project is linked to the GitHub repository.

160
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:23,170
Now, we should be able to simply push any work that we do,

161
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:27,410
any code, any notebooks that we create to this GitHub repository.

162
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:29,090
So let's go back to the notebook.

163
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:30,910
So we close this,

164
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:34,140
and I'll just go to the Assets tab.

165
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:38,260
You should find your notebook under the Notebooks section.

166
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,160
Click the Edit icon.

167
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,455
Then to publish this notebook,

168
00:13:52,455 --> 00:13:59,800
click on the Publish icon and select Publish on GitHub.

169
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:04,410
Now, make sure that all the settings here are

170
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:08,105
the ones that you're comfortable with so make sure that all the content is

171
00:14:08,105 --> 00:14:17,350
published except for hidden code cells and then click publish, and that's it.

172
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:23,110
Now, you can go to your repository and view the notebook.

173
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:28,090
Let's go to your GitHub account,

174
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:33,115
refresh the page and there you go.

175
00:14:33,115 --> 00:14:35,080
Now, note two things.

176
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:42,515
First, the commit comment says that the notebook was published from datascience.ibm.com.

177
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:48,595
This means that you're Watson Studio account was used to publish this notebook.

178
00:14:48,595 --> 00:14:51,740
Now, if you try to view the notebook,

179
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:58,690
the hidden cell now shows the code was removed by DSX for sharing.

180
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:02,420
This is super convenient because instead of

181
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,985
worrying about deleting cells with sensitive information,

182
00:15:05,985 --> 00:15:10,300
you can simply add the hidden cell comment and that will prevent

183
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:16,395
the content from being revealed to your peers or collaborators, and that's it for now.

184
00:15:16,395 --> 00:15:18,700
I'll see you in the next video.
