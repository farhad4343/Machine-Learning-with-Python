00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:05,090
All right, before we start
learning about foursquare and

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:08,850
their API, let's get some of
the logistics out of the way.

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:13,660
For this project, we will be using
Watson Studio as the platform

4
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:18,450
to build our code for the project and
to share it with our peers.

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:22,100
So each of you will need to
create a Watson Studio account

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,420
in order to proceed with the course.

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,025
And in this video I will walk
you through the process.

8
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:35,399
Now for those you who don't know,
Watson Studio is an awesome platform that

9
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,174
provides a suite of tools for data
other scientists to collaboratively and

10
00:00:40,174 --> 00:00:45,470
easily work with application developers,
and subject matter experts.

11
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,900
And to build, train, and
deploy models at scale.

12
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:53,570
For the sake of this project, we won't
be doing any extensive machine learning.

13
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,610
But by using Watson Studio and

14
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:59,630
learning about its features, you will
hopefully appreciate what it has to offer.

15
00:01:02,363 --> 00:01:06,720
So let's go to the following link that is

16
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,600
www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-studio.

17
00:01:16,685 --> 00:01:20,190
This will take you to the landing
page of Watson Studio.

18
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:24,510
Feel free to check it out to
learn more about its features and

19
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:27,040
what the platform has to offer.

20
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,840
You can also watch the video
to learn more about it.

21
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,842
And once you're ready
to create an account,

22
00:01:35,842 --> 00:01:38,731
you can simply click on
Start your free trial.

23
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,667
This will bring you to a page where
you have to enter your email address.

24
00:01:47,383 --> 00:01:48,419
So I'm going to do that.

25
00:01:55,188 --> 00:01:57,560
And then check the box
to accept the terms.

26
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,151
Once you've done that, click Next.

27
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:13,910
This will redirect you to a page where you
have to fill in your personal details.

28
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:17,770
So go ahead and fill in your First and
Last Name, your Country or

29
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,410
Region, and a password for your account.

30
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:26,820
Then you can check the box if you wish
to remain informed about any products or

31
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,920
services by IBM.

32
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,677
And then scroll down and
click Create Account.

33
00:02:38,463 --> 00:02:43,003
Awesome, so at this point, you should
receive an email to confirm your account

34
00:02:43,003 --> 00:02:45,950
and to continue with this kind of process.

35
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:49,280
So go to your account and
follow the instructions in the email.

36
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,875
I'm going to do the same thing here.

37
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:56,411
[SOUND] By the way,
this is just a dummy account

38
00:02:56,411 --> 00:03:01,958
that I created for demonstration purposes.

39
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:02,770
There you go.

40
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:05,340
Here is the email from IBM Cloud.

41
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,107
So you click on the email and
you click Confirm Account.

42
00:03:14,649 --> 00:03:15,410
Awesome.

43
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,770
You should automatically then
get redirected to this page.

44
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:25,720
Now this page has all the details
about the IBM privacy policy, so

45
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,760
feel free to read it to understand
the policy and your rights as a user.

46
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,592
Then scroll down all the way to
the bottom and click proceed.

47
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:44,390
Here you can specify what account
to use and the organization.

48
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:48,120
And the IBM cloud space,
in case you have more than one.

49
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,752
But for most of you, you can simply
go with the default settings, so

50
00:03:51,752 --> 00:03:52,982
just click Continue.

51
00:03:55,717 --> 00:03:57,968
Right now we'll take some
time to create your account.

52
00:04:00,749 --> 00:04:02,070
There you go.

53
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:05,910
And that completes the process
of signing up on Watson Studio.

54
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,187
Now you can click Get Started.

55
00:04:09,261 --> 00:04:12,919
Once you get to this page,
you're good to go and

56
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:16,950
you're good to start
creating new projects.

57
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:20,647
Now in the next video,
I'll show you how to create a project and

58
00:04:20,647 --> 00:04:23,457
how to start creating notebooks
under that project and

59
00:04:23,457 --> 00:04:27,117
how to share them with your peers or
other collaborators.

60
00:04:27,117 --> 00:04:28,317
So I'll see you in the next video.
